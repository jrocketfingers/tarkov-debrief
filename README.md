Roadmap (of sorts) at https://www.notion.so/Tarkov-Debrief-8302e492076d42f294c47356989448dc

> To debrief (v) : to carefully review upon completion

A strategy mapping tool. Paint.exe with pre-defined markers (PMC/scav/loot) and backgrounds (maps).

Tarkov strategies are hard to pre-define due to unknown spawns, and even harder to maintain due to routs and miscommunications. This tool can be used for planning, but the primary goal is to use it to *debrief* after a raid and analyze what happened.

### Why debrief?
Debriefing is a good practice for improving a squad's cohesion, understanding of callouts and overall review of misplays. Assumption here is that you can do it in a somewhat non-toxic way with a group of people you consider friends. Take advice with kindness, or kindly reject it.

You're already spending a lot of time setting up a loadout. Make it count by making it out alive, and more importantly, getting your squad out alive and looted up. Every death is a lesson.

Even in successful raids, take some time aside while unpacking your loot to talk through any unexpected or weird occurrences, be it ambushes, bugs, or cheaters.

### Known issues

- Panning is currently disabled due to how wonky modifier tools are. Use zoom to move around the map
- Some maps start way too zoomed-in (woods), due to a large difference in map resolution
- Initial loads are unoptimized
